# This is a basic to do list website
- You can make multiple lists for multiple settings (school, work etc.) and the lists will be shown horizontally from left to right
- You can set priority to the lists you make lists with priority 1 would be shown at the left end, then priority 2 
would be shown right next to it to the right and so on
- You can add/delete lists
- You can add/delete tasks to a list
- You can reorganize the position of each task in a list
- You can mark a task done
- Helps me by showing me all the different groups of tasks (school, work, clubs, health, miscellaneous etc.) I need to do together all in one place

# How to start the project 
Download the code, use GitHub desktop for ease of use
open the project in VScode
first make a .env file at the root of the server folder and add these two variables 
  PORT=3000 and
  MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@basic.c804vti.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Basic
replace username and password with your mongodb username and password (you need to set up a mongoDB account first and get the username and password)

in the terminal type "cd server"
then type "npm install"
then type "npm start"
when the backend starts on port 3000, go back one level in the terminal to the root of the project
so type "cd .."
then type "npm install"
then type "npm start"
the website should start on port 3001


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
